# Blood Bank Management System

The Blood Bank Management System (BBMS) is a robust web-based application designed to streamline blood donation processes, manage blood inventory efficiently, and enhance donor-recipient interactions. Leveraging Amazon Web Services (AWS) for secure and scalable cloud infrastructure, the project integrates MySQL Relational Database Service (RDS) for secure data storage, Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances for efficient processing, and AWS Lambda for serverless computing. The system's user-centric design, featuring a responsive frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enhances the overall experience for donors and healthcare professionals. The innovative use of PHP and the PHPMailer library enables seamless email notifications for blood requests. This project showcases expertise in cloud computing, database management, and full-stack development, with a focus on optimizing healthcare operations through technology.
